				<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
				<div id="table_of_contents">Please have Javascript enabled in your browser.</div>
				<h2>How to print out pages</h2>
				<p>This project is set up so that you may print out each page as you need it. If you want to print out a page it is quite easy. When you need to run to the bathroom with a need to read, heres what to do.</p>
				<p>Most web browser allow you to right click on the page and select print page. This will print the page with the text in it but not all the frames stuff or the side menu bar.</p>
				<p>The other option is to go to print page in the file menu and when asked how to print say print only selected frame.</p>
				<p>Good luck, problems e the webkeeper@topiyasplace.ca</p>
