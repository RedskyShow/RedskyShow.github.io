				<li>Nothing, sexual, or anything. I might be Certified, but I'm not crazy...!</li>
				<li>Hey! Who put this in the Gross Redsky Show In Text?!</li>

			<p><b>GROSS REDSKY:</b> Mr. Fuj Gross has agreed to address all those Natives of the North. Well, North of the Population Line, anyway. It's a serious subject. Apparently, many Natives in their Communities, commit suicide. The suicide rate is very high. Now, here to address this issue,.. is Mr. Fuj Gross...!</p>

			<p><b>FUJ GROSS:</b> Thank you, Mr. Gross Redsky, our host. Hello, everybody out there in the World, where ever you are! I'm your co-host, Fuj Gross, and this, is the Gross Redsky Show In Text! Today I'd like to help out those Natives of the North whom are contemplating suicide. Well, I'm one of you! See? I failed! I’m a Failure! You could,... be me! See?!... What I mean, is, I'm ALIVE! Yet, not because I ate people...</p>

			<p>We all have reasons to commit suicide. Contemplating suicide at some point in your life, is normal! Teen suicide rates are on the charts! What tops the scale, is, Native suicide rates, above the Canadian Population Line. I'm one of you! We're NUMBER (1) ONE!</p>

			<p>I've many reasons for committing suicide. Just look at my sex life! I've been desperate at times! Not getting any! Destitution is my enemy! Can't afford to buy a girl a cup of coffee at the best of times! Can't afford a hooker! When I could afford a hooker, there's none to be found! By the time someone mentions, "Escort Service," my money was spent on beer! In jail, I'd accidentally drop the soap constantly. No one would take advantage of me, (thank God!) Even when my Ex-wife paraded me around to all the local Gay Bars, same thing! So I gave up on any inkling of gay sex. I went back to chasing women! I started in on all the ugly women, first. I figured I stood a better chance! I had NO chance [With them.] If anyone deserves to have a reason to commit suicide, it's me!</p>

			<br />

			<p>All of my income tax refund went to bills! I used up my turn in the food bank, now I gotta wait a month! Not only am I suicidal,... I got the Blues... <i>"I'M PAWNED TO THE LIMIT, AND I'M IN DEBT TO THE HILT..."</i> (Repeat chorus)</p>

			<p><i>Thought I just found my new baby</i></p>
			<p><i>You know she works at the liquor store</i></p>
			<p><i>An' when I go see my new baby,</i></p>
			<p><i>I just got to buy liquor some more...! (Chorus)</i></p>
			<p><i>Other day I bumped into my landlord</i></p>
			<p><i>You know I fell one month behind</i></p>
			<p><i>What would he do if he found out,</i></p>
			<p><i>I was brewing my own moonshine...! (Chorus)</i></p>

			<p><b>FG</b></p>
