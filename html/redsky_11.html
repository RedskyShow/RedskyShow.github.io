			<p><b>The Rules About Smoking Pot! (Or, Pot Smoking)</b></p>

			<p>Get lots of air with your toke. In fact, you might wanna (want to) breathe deeply before toking. Then take in lots of air with your toke. Mix your toke with air... (Ever hear of dying of “Smoke Inhalation?”) If you know that you are going to choke, don’t inhale (toke...) (If you didn’t know that you were going to choke, it’s okay... Maybe it’s good stuff!)</p>

			<p>Try not to spit all over the end of the joint that you are passing on over to the next chum! ... (You’re practically kissing...) I prefer my own joint and another for my chum(s), if necessary! How about your own pipe? The best way to scrimp on your stash and stretch it out is to use a hash pipe. Particularly if the stuff is so good, that all you need is a couple of tokes to get off (on it.) You can buy one at any Head Shop.</p>

			<p>Not all Pot is the same! You hear of many people and quantities of pot found and convicted, but you never hear of the quality of the pot. I am witness to the fact that, there is no quality pot where I live! You pretty much have to chain smoke it to get off. Perhaps the buzz is from a lack of oxygen! I knew of six different sources at one time. Seldom all at once, but at any given time. Now I’m down to three, seldom four sources for pot. None of it is any good. This is what people are getting busted for?! Crap! Pay Black Market prices for it though! Buzzable pot should go for about a buck a gram when it becomes legal. Just watch! It’ll be everywhere! Tobacco and alcohol made legal status, so should pot. Plus the strength of the pot you smoke will be written on the package. I have spoken!</p>

			<p>Who am I, anyway? Well, I’m your co-host, Fuj Gross, and this is the Gross Redsky Show In Text..!</p>

			<p><b>GROSS REDSKY:</b> Thank you Fuj Gross for that enlightening piece of trivia. However, we are not all POTHEADS around here!</p>

			<p><b>FUJ GROSS:</b> Yes we are...(!)</p>

			<p><b>GROSS REDSKY:</b> I’m referring to our readers. You can’t call all of our readers, “A bunch of potheads.”</p>

			<p><b>FUJ GROSS:</b> Well what would you have me call them, then,.. “Cops?”</p>

			<p><b>GROSS REDSKY:</b> Why not? Everybody should be able to read the Gross Redsky Show In Text! Get outta here! I’m not talking to you anymore! We’ve had enough of a Mister Fuj Gross for now! Where was I? Oh yeah!...</p>

			<p><b>FUJ GROSS:</b> You’re horning in on my segment, you know..?</p>

			<p><b>FG</b></p>
