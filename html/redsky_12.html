			<p><b>FUJ GROSS:</b> Gidday der byse! I’m glad to be here to face all ya readers. I’m your co-host, Fuj Gross, and this is the Gross Redsky Show In Text! I’d like to point out some of the inequities of our main host, a Mr. Gross Redsky... He indicated earlier that you had had enough of me. Well, as your main co-host of any situation, I hereby take leave...</p>
			
			<p><b>GROSS REDSKY:</b> Of your senses! You’ve had more than your turn, Fuj! This is MY show here! I believe that it’s time to hear someone else. One who’s opinion around here is long overdue...  People, I give you, the Leader Of The Right Arm Party (LOTRAP), Higmand Freud!</p>

			<p><b>HIGMAND FREUD:</b> Thank you, Mr. Fuj Gross and Mr. Gross Redsky,.. for taking up my space! Hello my people! It has been some time since the September 11th, 2001 incident, when a couple of passenger jets smashed into the World Trade Towers, in New York City, reducing the landmarks to a pile of rubble. Nobody at the Gross Redsky Show In Text has had a response to this situation and the aftermath. First, since I appear to be the only one around here who has any sense, I feel that it is my obligation to make an official statement, from the Right Arm Party (RAP)...</p>

			<p>All life forms within my jurisdiction..! Why do I feel like the only one around here who questions why people hate America so much? Everywhere you hear of [American] embassy bombings, kidnappings, hijackings, anthrax scares, and everything else! Why does the whole world seem to hate America so much? That’s my question! You should wonder… I know why I do. They [Americans] are the biggest polluters in the world! Some even have attitudes. Ever meet someone from Texas? Just so happens that the President is from Texas. He’s practically the biggest murdering Redneck alive! So I hear. He’s got volumes on his personality. He’s an object for Comedians. (Well, so is anybody.) But he’s tainted.</p>

			<p>I, as Leader Of The Right Arm Party (LOTRAP), believe that there are more subtle ways to uncover and arrest the perpetrators of this crime [of September 11th.] Certainly more subtle than blowing up an entire country [Afghanistan] and launching an invasion. How convenient that this bumpkin [President George W. Bush] can just bill Congress and the American people! I think he enjoys killing people! He has a track record! How many innocents were murdered under his regime? His whole [Republican] Party loves war! After all, (they think) it’s good for the economy.</p>

			<p>I have a different approach than war. I have the design of a whole new economy. As your Leader, I will have the final say. Basically, no war! Instead, generating an economy without war. I believe in ecologically sound industries. We have the technology. Lets live in harmony with the Earth rather than abusing her and taking advantage of her. We should look after her! That’s the Red Man way. I believe in Red Man Ideals! Let’s go green! Let us look into alternative fuels and power sources. Sewage is a gold mine as methane! Let’s look into burning clean methane for helicopters and automobiles! There’s grain fuels! Solar power with battery backups can be used for low energy stuff. All kinds of things,...</p>
