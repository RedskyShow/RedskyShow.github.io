			<h1>The Gross Redsky Show In Text</h1>
			<h2>Segment (20) Twenty</h2>

			<p><b>THE QUEBECOIS SQUAW FROM OTTAWA:</b> A Toltec is a person whose life's mission is to seek knowledge of the mysteries of our awesome world and universe to avoid an ordinary death. A Toltec Warrior acts upon this knowledge with impeccable intent. They can then manipulate the lines of the world and know their death so they may achieve freedom. Upon gathering enough Power through their impeccable actions, a Toltec gains the freedom to see beyond the global contract of everyday perception and escapes the mundane existence of the limited awareness of a singular reality. To an accomplished Toltec Warrior, this awesome planet is a banquet feast of multitudes of co-existing worlds. A warrior moves within the everyday world but does not succumb to the anesthetizing effect of our planets' predominant perceptions.</p>

			<p>The dominant perception of this world is held together by the contract we have all made at a very early stage in our lives. This contract was unwittingly thrust upon us by our well-meaning caretakers who had this reality thrust upon them and so on, and so on over centuries. I challenge you to seek the knowledge to gain the personal power to break the contract and free yourself from the slavery of this mass illusion! To accomplish this, I bathe you in the power of my intent and fight so that someday freedom may come to us all. I am a warrior because I engage myself in a constant battle against my basic human indulgences of thought and action as well as the everyday perception of most of humanity. Let me tell you, it is one intense, relentlessly demanding battle and a heck of a way of life to take on. I do it because once a taste of freedom, the acquisition of power and the ability to use it have been attained, there is no turning back.</p>

			<p>God! What a long segment.  Now you know why one of my names is Moonwind. I feel the onslaught of the agitation of a Mr. Fuj Gross. His intent seems to be to get me to shut up as quickly as possible. He appears to be bored to death! I also seem to have the patient and thoughtful attention of the Right Reverent Revered Abbot (RRRA). I think it is time I call it a day. I’ll be headed back across the Portage Bridge to wander the Gatineau hills seeking Power.</p>

			<p>I have so much more to share, if Mr.Gross Redsky would kindly have me back on his show. I would like to discuss prostitution and why I agree with Higmand Freud that it should be legal, (although probably not for the reasons he would like to see it legalized.) I would also like to discuss methods for coping with the devastation of losing your Personal History. The Arts of Dreaming and Stalking; gambling, drug use and abuse and the overwhelming urge to annihilate ourselves when faced with the sobering realization of the utter aloneness that is our individual lot. We can indulge in distractions up to yin-yang but we all have to die! The only escape is to achieve freedom, so make every moment count. In fact, 99.99% of you will still die, but it does not have to be an ordinary death. Aren’t I just a barrel of laughs?!</p>

			<p>P.S. I will never ask any of you readers to send me money directly. Mr.Gross Redsky will be giving me half of all profits made from this show! After all, it’s my pearls of wisdom, and my segments that will generate the overwhelming urge and intent you all feel to open your pocketbooks to ensure the continuation of the Gross Redsky Show In Text so you may periodically have access to my thoughts and opinions. Until next time.......</p>
