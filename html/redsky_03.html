			<p><b>GROSS REDSKY:</b> Welcome to the Gross Redsky Show In Text. I'm your host, Gross Redsky. Today on our show I have Higmand Freud. He's the leader of the new-found Canadian National Party, the Right Arm Party (RAP)...</p>

			<p><b>HIGMAND FREUD:</b> Thank you Gross Redsky for that introduction. Yes, I am the Leader Of The Right Arm Party (LOTRAP). I must correct you, Mr. Redsky; we are not yet a Canadian National Party, but we'll get there. As of this date, I am a Party Of One (POO). My Party, God willing, will meet at every level of government! I hope to create a â€˜Multilateral Party.' So far, it is only a theory, but we will run locally, provincially, federally, even, worldly! The Right Arm Party will be the first World Party. A Party that respects First World Ideals and Practices, such as preserving species and allotting them a habitat of wild proportions. Feeding ourselves from an increasing abundance, rather than a shrinking food supply, [i.e. fish stocks]. My Party promotes vegetarianism and promises a decrease of meat consumption, resulting in a bottoming out of that market.</p>

			<p>I believe in New Markets, Ergonomic Markets, Nature Approved Markets, to emerge and make just as much money. Paper should be made out of more renewable hemp rather than tree pulp. Industrial hemp is generally not good for smoking. Another thing, I'm outraged at the fact that tobacco and alcohol, two of the worst drugs in existence, yet they are commonly available. Indulge in pot and you go to jail with a criminal record! In my regime, pot is legal! What of prostitution? Today in the current regime we have strip clubs and lap dancing... Yet one of the most honest relationships there is, that being: Sex for Money! That! Is Outlawed! I'm outraged! Prostitution is legal in my regime. We could help track down disease and cater to individual needs. Who decreed that "Sex", is "Illegal?"  Or even "Immoral?" I didn't! Morals are one thing, but can you outlaw morals? My moral is to get some sex if I choose, with whom I choose. Who cares if it happens to be a prostitute? We should be teaching everyone about safe sex. I believe that everybody is different. Different body chemistry, [i.e. not everybody is going to choose to smoke pot. Not everybody is going to choose to have sex, smoke tobacco, or drink alcohol].</p>

			<p>I believe that society is afraid of it's own weaknesses. Those in control feel that everybody is going to fall to their vices. So ban it and solve the problem. But I say it doesn't solve the problem. It creates new problems that emerge. Ban sex and we have new problems. Ban pot and we have a big problem. I agree that as a society we should have some controls. But that is what the Right Arm Party is for. I, as your leader, have the ability to pick from the membership or outside the membership of the Right Arm Party to choose some of the best minds in the World! Policy has yet to be formulated. For now, I just have one policy: Red Man Ideals! That's my policy. Better land management! Live in harmony with the universe! Go Green! Perpetuate every species! Respect life! Promote safe sex and lower our abortion rate! Doesn't sex mean more to both of you if you do it to procreate? Ban clear cutting of our forests and the poisoning of our fresh water! The list may be endless. The membership will have even more ideas. I'm just one man. I reach out to you...</p>
