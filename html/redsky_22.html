			<p><b>RRRA:</b> Enough! I've had enough! What did I tell you about a Mr. Fuj Gross? I had said that he had little in the way of redeeming qualities! He is NOT a model for human behaviour! For one thing, it doesn’t matter what your girlfriend looks like, for we are all beautiful in the eyes of God! Fuj Gross had you believe that a Lady is to be, “Good enough to be seen with in public."...(!) And he refers to a, "Not-too-shabby-girl."..(!) It seems a Mr. Fuj Gross is more concerned with one’s, 'Appearance,' rather than her, 'Drive,' her, 'Soul &amp; Character,' even, 'Her Bearing...!'</p>

			<p>Mr. Fuj Gross had just recently claimed that he was, "Suicidal."..(!) Why? For lack of sex! Some of the Greatest Men In History, lived and died as celibate virgins! Look them up! The Risen Christ, was One. Well, I agree that it is normal to, at some point in your life, contemplate suicide...! It may surprise some of our Fellow Parishioners, that I, too, at several points in my life, have also contemplated suicide. Any reason is enough for most people. Rejection; Work; Family; Finances; Love life... and that's just my list! But I overcame my suicidal tendencies! As do most people.</p>

			<p>I now have a zeal, and a zest for establishing the Abbey of the Right Reverent Revered Abbott (RRRA)! This Abbey confirms every established Religion. I, as founder, believe in the Hindu Gods Shiva &amp; Krishna! I have yet to read the Veda Scriptures. But they outdate the Holy Bible! I believe in the Vulgate Scriptures! I've read some of the margins. I believe in the Pagan Gods and the Aztec Gods! I'll tell you why. God keeps appearing to us. I believe that He has depicted many forms to Mankind, and upon several continents. It is no accident that the Aztec God Tlaloc is on the same Pyramid as the God Quetzcoatl. I believe that they are the Same God! God had appeared to the Ancestor of the Jews, as Three Men! That story is written somewhere...! I am familiar with legendary stories from several different sources! And all of them point to the existence of God, and the Entire Heavenly Host! The ROOTS of my Abbey come from the Holy Land, the Holy Bible, the story of the Jews, and the Risen Christ!  However, at this Millennium, I will not be naive...!</p>

			<p>My  Abbey can Marry your pets...! You merely have to purchase the CERTIFICATE. We don't have the funds to provide that for you. I can also certify, by my Church &amp; Abbey, same sex marriages. However, they will not be legal until you are signed by an Authority, such as a Ship’s Captain, Justice of the Peace, or Authorized Priest. Or until they change the Law...! My Church &amp; Abbey is not yet established. Like Higmand Freud, I am a Party Of One (POO). The forms have yet to be filled out. It all starts with ONE.</p>

			<p>The power of one is awesome! It can change the world. That is the power of our home page web site, topiyasplace.ca That is the power of one. With the doubling effect, it will soon become a multitude. The voice of a multitude can shatter worlds! It all begins with one voice. Submit your voice to both the Gross Redsky Show In Text &amp; to topiyasplace.ca &amp; you will make a difference. I have spoken..!</p>
