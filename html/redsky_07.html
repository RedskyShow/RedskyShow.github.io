			<p><b>GROSS REDSKY:</b> Hello, this is Gross Redsky. Welcome to my show. Well, I got the motor started. That is to say that my show is up and running. I warned you that my show would run all over the map in a variety fashion. I never expected to hear one of my own co-hosts refer to it as, “A crappie show!” What do they expect? They’re the ones co-producing the very show they’ve criticized! Geez! ... I’m not sure if I even want to put any of them on again, you know? Tell me, what do you think of my co-hosts so far?</p>

			<p>I have some sad news to report. Apparently, my show will not be acquiring the Bitchy Squaw from The Pas, Manitoba. But… there’s talk that I may be acquiring the Quebecois Squaw From Ottawa instead. Who knows when the heck that’ll happen? If I become successful, I will sponsor and produce a Pageant: Who wants to be The Mighty Squaw from The Pas, Manitoba? I’d do it in The Pas, Manitoba. In fact, why not the Mighty Squaw from Wawa? Or Oshawa? Or any place whatsoever? I get ideas all of the time. Just no dime to support them.</p>

			<p>I have other characters to show you. Other co-hosts, if you will. But you will have to wait until I bring my show to Speaker’s Corner, as I’ve mentioned earlier. Prince Edward has agreed to do a stint on my show. You’ll just have to see if that happens. Gastion BBBB is a Quebecer who struggles with his, “Hinglish.” Then there’s the Quebecois Squaw from Ottawa. I got to see that for myself! I’ve met the cousins, Bjarn Bjorn, and, Bjorn Bjarn. They’re proud to be “Born in a barn,” and be Swedish or whatever. However, they refuse to come on my show! One year, perhaps.</p>

			<p>I tried the restaurants recommended by Fuj Gross. They rock, as he puts it. I have another file segment for you soon. It’s about suicide and it’s directed to those Natives of the North who struggle with suicide all the time. Depressing communities of the Canadian North rank tops’ in the world of suicide! Gasoline sniffing and glue. I say, let them have pot! It should be cheaper and contain a massive THC level. Not like the stuff you get in Ottawa. I’m going to leave Ottawa eventually so that I can move to a place that has better pot! Like Vancouver. You need a port city to get quality pot at decent cost. I believe that it’s the government who is providing the residents of Ottawa with low-grade hemp for smoking. It has to be a conspiracy! I don’t do heavy drugs or alcohol. I smoke marijuana for the same reason that others may drink alcohol, a mild buzz. I stick to beer that has an alcohol content, preferably, under five percent without resorting to light beer. That’s why I prefer an American brewed beer. Less than five percent alcohol so that I can drink more of it. Most of us at the Gross Redsky Show In Text have similar tastes and come from a similar background. The Quebecois Squaw from Ottawa, however, does not drink alcohol or beer. I’ve known her to occasionally drink something sweet or bubbly. As a rule, the most she has is a dollop of beer in a large glass of diet ginger ale. Would she indulge a little more if she were more financially secure? Who knows? Financial constraints do little to restrict some people from drinking and being disorderly or poisoning themselves with alcohol. Some fallibility isn’t too bad, but too much creates a change in the climate, plus an extinction of our species, languages and cultures... Keep tuned!</p>
