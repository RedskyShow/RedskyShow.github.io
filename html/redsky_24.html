			<h1>The Gross Redsky Show In Text</h1>
			<h2>Segment (24) Twenty Four</h2>
			<h2>Sunday, April 27, 2003 9:47 PM</h2>

			<p>Good day. I'm Fuj Gross, your CO-host here on the Gross Redsky Show In Text. I have just read an article in the Ottawa Sun. Pardon me, I tried, to read an article in the Ottawa Sun, here, in Ottawa, Canada on the date of this show. I couldent't bring myself to read the article any further because I immediately could see that the author had a bias opinion against marijuana. I bet he went home, smoked a cigarette, then poured himself an alcoholic beverage. What's the matter with you people..?!</p>

			<p>Do you realize how many times worse for you are the chemicals, alcohol &amp; tobacco..?(!) Eh!? Why can I buy tobacco &amp; alcohol, yet you throw me in jail with a criminal record, force me through rehab, for being natural..?(!) I cannot smoke the marijuana that's supposed to grow wild, before it was hunted to death! By laws &amp; police. Even sex is illegal! You force people to pick up some diseased prostitute or undesirable person &amp; you force them through rehab &amp; give them criminal records! I believe in a change of government that would cater to individual needs &amp; help track down disease! Yes! I'm yelling at you so that you might hear me!</p>

			<p>Okay, I'll try to contain myself. I bet people are threatened at the institution of marriage being dissolved if we made prostitution legal. Are they the same ones who are in power, &amp; influence power who might believe that the institutions of alcohol &amp; tobacco might be threatened if we were to legalize marijuana? What's the main argument here? Did we legalize a moral principle against people having sex? Especially when we should be teaching about safe sex, &amp; fun sex? (For pleasure.) I believe in a government that forces the porn industry to initiate, "safe sex." They could be creative, I bet. They could use Canadian writers &amp; actors. (We'll show them interesting.) Hire me!</p>

			<p>I promise not to mention, "sex," anymore. Let's talk about, "marijuana," huh? Is it really this bad narcotic that everyone would have you believe? No! I can't even find the good stuff they purportedly report about, or seize! Where is it? I want some! The stuff I get is crap! I don't like alcohol because it makes me sick! It gives me a hangover! (Sorry, I'm yelling again.) I quit smoking tobacco a while ago because I was smart. My only vice is to get a little lift off a joint. But I can't even find the good stuff. How sad for me. Go to your tobacco &amp; alcohol you hypocrites!</p>
