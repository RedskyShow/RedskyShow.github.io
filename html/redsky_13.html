			<p><b>FUJ GROSS:</b> Anyway, so I was drunk enough that this girl was beginning to look real good. I mean, this bitch was sexy!.. Hey! How come you put the record button on?</p>

			<p><b>RRRA:</b> Oh, I was going to do a segment of the Gross Redsky Show In Text.</p>

			<p><b>FUJ GROSS:</b> What, in the middle of my confession?! Is it my confession that you want to feature? Is this what your flock can expect from you in confession? A broadcast?!</p>

			<p><b>RRRA:</b> Hardly...! Your confession is hardly worth broadcast material. It’s just the same old dribble with you, isn’t it? Just call her bluff and do the DNA test. Now, out of here!</p>

			<p><b>FUJ GROSS:</b> But...!</p>

			<p><b>RRRA:</b> Call me later, as you always do, but leave me some time for myself, will you? You’re taking up my space! I’m due for a show here...!</p>

			<p>Good day fellow reformed, or otherwise, sinners! I am not here to judge you. That is the Lord’s job. I am your Right Reverent Revered Abbott (RRRA) at your service! In the service of the Lord. Now, I would like to tell you a short story that happened while I was with our main co-host of the Gross Redsky Show In Text, a Mr. Fuj Gross...</p>

			<p>Good people of my flock, my church finds no shame in dancing women. In fact, dancing women have been with us since biblical times. Mr. Fuj Gross pointed out that very fact, as he invited me to lunch at a place that featured dancing women. In fact, he graciously offered to buy me the luncheon buffet if, perhaps, I were to purchase him merely one drink. Well! My situation does, at times permit me to indulge in a meal or two at other’s expense; therefore I accepted his terms.</p>

			<p>Fuj Gross took me to a place called, “Barbarella’s,” on Queen Street, in uptown Ottawa, near Lyon. The first thing that I noticed was the female dancer on the main stage. She was obviously attractive! What was also obvious was that she was practically naked, and further undressing! ... Well, okay, so dancing nudes have been with us since biblical times, as Mr. Fuj Gross so pointedly mentioned to me, his confessor! My church is not offended at the sight of dancing nudes. It’s an art form really. In fact,.. even the waitress was worthy of being undressed with your eyes, and, she was not offended! That was Mr. Fuj Gross, by the way, doing the undressing, ... (ahem.)</p>

			<p>The second thing I noticed was if you are there between certain hours, the buffet is free! They give you a poker chip to pay for the meal, free! I’ll have you know that I was not to be swindled by a Mr. Fuj Gross, even for a drink! Well, I got him to pay for my drink! He immediately burst into laughter, slapped me on the back and confessed to me that he was only joking! Joking, indeed! He tried to get a free drink out of me! Free meal?!  Fellow sinners, members of my flock! I forgive him his sins and follow Christ’s example!</p>
