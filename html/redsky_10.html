			<p><b>FUJ GROSS:</b> My cat is named “Malcolm.” There’s a professional athlete named, “Nedermeyer.” I have just realized that it is more difficult to say, “ Malcolm Nedermeyer Meaner-Minor,” than it is to say, “Malcolm Meaner-Minor Nedermeyer!” Go figure! ...</p>

			<p>Where was I? ... Oh yeah! Welcome to the Gross Redsky Show In Text. I’m your co-host, Fuj Gross.</p>

			<p>Today on our show, I have to pine away for a lost sweetheart...</p>

			<p><b>BABY COME BACK!</b></p>

			<p>Good day! I was once in a park in Toronto when I met this girl. She was attractive enough. In fact, if I were drunk, ... she woulda’ looked even better. She was the kind of girl you don’t mind being seen with in public. In fact, she was even better looking than the last girl I had sex with! She, was a not-too-shabby-girl! Okay, now that we got that straight...</p>

			<p>Anyway, we started talkin’ pretty good. Right close to the middlin’of a few exchanges with her, I asked her where she was from. She replied that she was from London, meaning Ontario. So I casually mentioned, perhaps with some reverence, that there are more millionaires in London than anywhere else in Canada. So..!</p>

			<p>So, what does she do? She puts an end to the conversation and walks off! ... Okayyy! So,.. what?! Are you some kind of millionaire?! Perhaps?! Did I offend you somehow???!</p>

			<p>I’m sorry, baby! Please!!! Come back..! I didn’t mean to mention that there were more millionaires in London, Ontario, than anywhere else in Canada! Honest! Please,.. come back to me!! I promise that I won’t ever mention that again! I promise not to cost you too much, too! Please, Baby(!) All I need is a hundred bucks per day, for my allowance! American for now. Let’s make it a thousand bucks per week. Okay, fifty thousand, American, per year, for my lover’s allowance. Okay? Baby?! That’s fair ...(!?) You know I gotta look good for you, Baby. Plus, I’d feel better if I were able to buy you the odd something, as well. Like a drink. Or a meal. Or that nice perfume or object, for you, Baby...!</p>

			<p><i>Please, Baby,...! Come back...!</i></p>
			<p><b>FJ</b></p>

			<br />
			<p><b>GROSS REDSKY:</b>  I don’t know how this segment got in here! This isn’t the personal-personals for personal postings for a Mr. Fuj Gross..! I’m trying to run a show here. Any further segments marked, “Baby Come Back,” will come under review. I have spoken!</p>
