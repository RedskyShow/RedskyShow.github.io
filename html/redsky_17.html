			<h2>Segment (17) Seventeen</h2>
			<h2>Tuesday 2002 02 05 00:04 AM</h2>

			<p><b>GORDON ROSS:</b> Welcome to the Gross Redsky Show In Text! Mr.Gross Redsky requested I come here to address the readers and listeners around the Globe. I am the treasurer and head accountant at the Gross Redsky Show In Text. You may call me “Ross.” Make your cheques and money orders payable to G Ross, Box # 287, 505A Gladstone Avenue, Ottawa, Canada K1R 5N9. Gross Redsky had thought it best for me to come here, on the show, and ease everybody’s mind about the security of all funds sent to the Gross Redsky Show In Text.</p>

			<p>I have known Gross Redsky for years. In fact, I was there when he met a few of the show’s characters! I was with him when he created this show. I have lent him money and held his money for him. I’m trusted and well respected at the Gross Redsky Show In Text.</p>

			<p>I am the one who posts the letters and designates the percentages to their correct sources. All the money goes through me! The RRRA has his money deposited to his account. I’m the one who puts it there! You may assume that practically everyone at the Gross Redsky Show In Text will be asking you for money at some point. All of it is payable to me! When they acquire some products I will forward them to you.</p>

			<p>Fuj Gross has bumper stickers and “fill in yourself” video logs to market.</p>

			<p>Higmand Freud, of the Right Arm Party, (LOTRAP) gave me the information about his Certificates. I am producing the hard copy.</p>

			<p>His Royal Majesty Chief, The Chief of Priests (CP) has yet to come on this show. Yet I am in possession of his Commandam regarding Crowfoot. The Commandam will be available on parchment (for a small fee) courtesy of the Gross Redsky Show In Text!</p>

			<p>I’m the secretary, and the gofer! When Gross Redsky needed a moneyman to keep things straight, he and everybody at the Gross Redsky Show In Text trusted me with this delicate responsibility! My appointment also made me the CFO (Chief Financial Officer), thus attesting to my capabilities! We are sincerely hoping that this will calm all qualms you may have about making your money payable to the Treasurer (CFO): Gordon Ross, Box # 287, 505A Gladstone Avenue, Ottawa, Canada K1R 5N9. Please rest assured that your products will be shipped to you promptly, your inquiries will be attended to immediately and all monies earmarked to each particular individual at the Gross Redsky Show In Text, will definitely get to that person.</p>

			<p><b>GROSS REDSKY:</b> Thank you Ross, for your kind assurances. I know I trust you to hold my money for me as do the all the folks here at the Gross Redsky Show In Text...</p>

			<p>Speaking of the other co-hosts... we were supposed to hear from the Quebecois Squaw From Ottawa! She sure has a lot to say. You should hear her rave at times! But she has yet to enter any text! I hope she won’t be a no-show. I’m quickly losing faith in her ever dragging her sorry ass down here! But, let me tell you, the Quebecois Squaw From Ottawa can sure spurt some entertaining dialogue! Till next time...</p>
