			<p><b>RRRA:</b> Hello my parishioners! I am your Right Reverent Revered Abbott (RRRA)! Welcome to the Gross Redsky Show In Text! Just look at any player in the NHL. What is he in your mind? White? Rugged? From a ragged background? He has no qualms about carrying his stick in the midst of all the Black Players in the National Hockey League (NHL). However, have you noticed that there are few, if any, Black Players in the National Hockey League?! If Black Players were allowed on the ice, the other players wouldn’t be allowed to carry sticks! God forbid if you should see a bunch of White Men waving sticks in the presence of a Black Man!</p>

			<p>I have noticed, too, that many professional basketball teams in the NBA now have a token White Guy playing. Some teams may even have two! What happens when you, “cream the coffee,” so to speak? Should I tell you...?</p>

			<p>Fellow parishioners! What happens when you blend the Colours of Man into each other? We all know what happens to blended species... Such offspring cannot produce children to perpetuate their species, such as a mule. The mule is the offspring of a horse and a donkey. Granted, they produce a child. But that child cannot produce a child. Such is the result of inter-species breeding. A mangling and mangled bastard who cannot reproduce! To achieve such disasters genetically in human terms, simply begin by producing disastrous bastard children with your sister or brother! However, if the different colours of Human Being intermarry and start having children, they produce healthier and stronger children! For we are ALL human. We are merely of different families. Keeping the family line pure, is about the most disastrous thing, genetically, that you could do to the family line. We all need fresh blood! Fresh blood makes us stronger, healthier and keeps us sharp! Distinctive characteristics are a worthy and good thing to cultivate!</p>

			<p>Fellow parishioners! The roots of my church stem from the Christianity that was brought over from the Holy Land, by way of Scotland! The Right Reverent Revered Abbott (RRRA) wears the Ross Tartan, and my Abbey came by way of Applecross. First it was my grandfather, and then it was I, who saw the Lord God Almighty seated enthroned in heaven. My grandfather, a Black Man, and I each witnessed this sight on the 5th of May. That date is my deemed fast! I fast on that day to honour the memory of that sight. If you care to honour Christ’s memory, pick a day that is special to you. If we all fast on the same day, Higmand Freud informs me that the economy would crash! My church supports a strong and vibrant economy!</p>

			<p>Should anyone care to support the Church of the Right Reverent Revered Abbott (RRRA), you may direct your donations to The Treasurer: G Ross, c/o Gross Redsky, Box # 287, 505A Gladstone Ave., Ottawa, ON, K1R 5N9 or e-mail: grossredsky@canada.com</p>

			<p>Some parishioners may wish to paper me with their chequebooks, however, it would feel good to know that your heart is in it as well. Feedback is the lifeblood of any good media! Let me know if I strike you, and/ or break you, from this bathroom book!</p>
