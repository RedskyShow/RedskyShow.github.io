			<p><b>THE QUEBECOIS "SQUAW" FROM OTTAWA:</b> Greetings All! Welcome to my segment of the Gross Redsky Show In Text. Thank you Mr. Gross Redsky for inviting me to the show. Youâ€™re right about one thing; I certainly have a lot to say. Dear Mr. Redsky, oh yea of little faith!  How could you doubt I would show up? Have a little patience man. Are your petty doubts an attempt to insult me?! I gave you my word. The word of a Toltec Warrior is not to be taken lightly. In fact, I am the Left Hand Of The Right Arm Party (LHOTRAP)!</p>

			<p>On the subject of the title "Squaw:" I trust Mr. Redsky uses the term in a modern manner and with "Positive Intent," thereby connoting respect. For those of you who are unaware, the term "Squaw" was not originally a Native Indian term although over time it has been adopted in some Native Circles as a term of affection. This is akin to Black thug youth street gangs adopting the term "Nigger" as a term of endearment within their homeboy circles.</p>

			<p>As you may have deduced, the terms "Nigger" and "Squaw" are not usually considered respected terms; especially by Women and Men of Knowledge. I do not mean educated people. I mean what I said, Women and Men of Knowledge, although many are educated as well.</p>

			<p>Due to the nature of the Gross Redsky Show In Text, I have decided to not take offense by the term "Squaw" used in this context. In future though, you may call me by the name Vena Moonwind Pink Pelt (VMPP) from the Micmac Indians who populated the Maritime Provinces under the tribe of Blue Sky Miners. On more familiar terms, Vena Moonwind Pink Pelt (VMPP) may be abbreviated to Moonwind PP. I do not have a Band, as back then we walked in our own world and not the bureaucracy of the world of early White Man government. Over time, some of us assimilated with Europeans and freedom seeking Black Slaves who fled the Southwest U.S.A. My ancestors made their way to Quebec from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick... but I digress.</p>

			<p>Getting back to the term "Squaw." The original White Male Patriarchal Settlers were overcome by the beauty of the Native Indian Women and threatened by their healing powers and their understanding of the natural world. In their petty ignorance they hated what they did not have the capacity to understand. To make themselves feel powerful they attempted to smear the dignity and control the sexuality of these powerful women. The White Man called the Native Women, "Squaw," meaning "Whore," a degenerate term to degrade these women as viscously as they raped them. The Europeans considered them evil because of the women's' harmonious relationship with Mother Earth and because of the women's opposition to the manner in which the Christian clergy oppressed, in the name of God, while also raping and pillaging Mother Earth. Many of these early settlers were disrespectful of other ways of life and felt no qualms in dictating and oppressing in the name of Christianity. Jesus, The Christ would weep at the destruction and degradation. I am certain he does not approve from his heavenly quarters of this nauseating way of life. I challenge you to meditate on these facts before you lightly refer to anyone as "Squaw." Upon knowing these facts, if Mr. Redsky deigns to call me "Squaw" outside of this silly show, he is a fool.</p>
