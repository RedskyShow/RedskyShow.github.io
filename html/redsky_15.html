			<p><b>HIGHMAND FREUD:</b> I am the Leader Of The Right Arm Party (LOTRAP), Higmand Freud. Hello all life forms within my jurisdiction! Welcome to the Gross Redsky Show In Text! Today I would like to increase the membership of my Party... I have indicated in a previous segment of the show, that the Right Arm Party (RAP), currently, is a world party of one (1)... ! I have worked out a payment schedule...</p>

			<p>To become a lifetime member of the Right Arm Party (RAP) requires payment of a one-time membership fee of $100.00 Canadian, and a written application from you. I will send you a “Certificate of Membership” duly noting you as a lifetime member in good standing. You may register your pets, or nominate anyone you wish for the lifetime membership fee of $100.00 Canadian. $30.00 Canadian yearly subscription renewal fee.</p>

			<p>As we have yet to form official Party Status, or even fill out the forms, your paid fees will not be tax deductible as the Right Arm Party (RAP) is in the initial stage of formation. But then, so are a lot of concerned Citizens, who could do a lot of good with the money. The Right Arm Party (RAP) is committed to running in any level of Government. Once able, (through your steadfast and generous support) the Right Arm Party (RAP) will fund training centers, so that our future, our children, and capable, reliable workers, can be informed about the real jobs that need doing!</p>

			<p>The Right Arm Party (RAP) believes in counseling, preventative medicine, and measures that prevent sickness and unnecessary costs before they occur! I believe in hiring intelligent social worker medicine cops that get to the root of the problems before they become epidemic. They will report on all situations they come across and promptly address the problem at hand. I mean any problem! Social, political and personal, ... I could go on about the Right Arm Party (RAP).</p>

			<p> Recruitment has yet to commence for wanna-be-Candidates... That would take a written, and/or media application from the potential Candidates, and at least a million Canadian Dollars. Only Worthy Candidates need apply. You may send your cheques and money orders payable to the Treasurer of the Right Arm Party (RAP): G Ross, Box # 287, 505A Gladstone Ave., Ottawa, Ontario, K1R 5N9.</p>

			<p><b>GROSS REDSKY:</b> Thank you Mr. Higmand Freud for that riveting Segment!</p>

			<p><b>HIGMAND FREUD:</b> I’m sorry Mr. Gross Redsky, but I wasn’t quite finished yet! ...</p>

			<p><b>GROSS REDSKY:</b> Why don’t we leave our illustrious Readers in suspense, shall we?</p>

			<p><b>FUJ GROSS:</b> Yeah, guy! The boss likes to cut us all off and horn in on our segments from time to time! ...</p>

			<p><b>GROSS REDSKY:</b> Where did you come from?!</p>
