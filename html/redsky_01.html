			<p>Welcome to the Gross Redsky Show in Text. In my world, over time, I will introduce you to several of my chosen co-hosts who will, I hope in the least, entertain you. Most of us come from a similar background. You will come to know us all, intimately, I hope. Perhaps, you may even like us. I hope that the result will be interesting, if not entertaining for general mass appeal. Who knows what I'll unleash unto the world? I hope that my Show In Text, runs all over the map in a variety fashion. When it expands to perform at regular intervals and be televised from, say, anywhere in Centretown, Ottawa, the variety of my show will extend to musical, even theatrical, productions.</p>
			<p>I will be a roving fashion critic. Oftentimes I spot fashion that you just got to see. You will have to wait until I get a camera or get televised to see all of this stuff!</p>
			<p>I found the Right Reverent Revered Abbot (RRRA) for you. He's my television commercial critic. He points out some of the unnatural phenomenon that you may or may not take for granted. The RRRA has full license to produce and direct his own segments on my show. He may even preach to you. I look forward to his fresh perspective.</p>
			<p>Perhaps one of my most dynamic co-hosts is, Higmand Freud. He's the leader of the Right Arm Party (RAP). This is a New World Party that he's hoping will get off the ground. I've listened to some of his rhetoric and I think that I want to hear more. I hope that you enjoy his segments as much as I'm sure to.</p>
			<p>It will be a long time from now, however I can promise you that eventually I will have the honour of introducing and presenting to you the colourful, Bitchy Squaw From The Pas, Manitoba. I might add that she is a Native Status Indian, and I'm a Native Status Indian, and it's not racist for Indians to call each other, "Squaw!" Just as the Black Race may call each other, "Nigger!" Well, that's my reasoning anyway. She has full license to interrupt any other co-host and take wing. Will she produce any segments of her own?</p>
			<p>Well, that's the opening of my show! I may have to pressure some of my co-hosts for the segments that I want to produce to you. We have a pulpit in this Web Site and I'd really like to take full advantage of it! So you, the reader, stay tuned and I'll see what I can squeeze out of my co-hosts. I'll give you a show even if I have to wing it alone. Why not? I've entertained before! Well, in front of the mirror, and to friends and family!</p>
			<p>When the time is right, perhaps, any year, we will all appear on Ottawa Speaks. This is the Ottawa version of Speaker's Corner on the television station, the New R.O., televised from The Market in Ottawa, Canada. I will call my segments, the Gross Redsky Show, and all of us, host and co-hosts, will appear to you in person. Then you can truly come to judge us all by how we appear to you on Ottawa Speaks. My goal is that this will lead to a New Television Series that I will create. Sort of what Gene Roddenberry is to the Star Trek Series, and what Joss Whedon is to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Series. At this point, it's all just a pipe dream. So stay tuned to this Web Site!</p>
