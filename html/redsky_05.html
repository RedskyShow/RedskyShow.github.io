			<p><b>FUJ GROSS:</b> You mangling cheap neurotic scum bag, you! You ever get the impression that everybody has that scowl on his/ her face? Miserable hunched...</p>

			<p>Some men only try for the girls who already look like they've been through a rough time in their lives. Now they're bitter. At least, I think that's what their scowl means. They got the hair for it, and the rumpled clothes. Some women even look like they paint the bruises upon their face. Hmm... I'll give myself a black eye today. Yeah, now I look, "Real bitter!"</p>

			<p>Sport the scowl. It's the in thing. You are not allowed to laugh. I see that glint in your eye! Stop it! Or I'll call the cops! You pig! You bastard! You son of a bitch!</p>

			<p>We need a new style for this bitterness craze. The scowl jacket, the scowl shirt and the new scowl cap. Cap it off in my new scowl boots and kick ass in this new, purely mental scowl craze. You notice that we don't have outright mobs of brawlers. No brawlers here. No, brawling is out,.. scowling is in. I got the new scowl skin protector... scowl shades. I'm on the scowl... You gotta walk straight. Straight into somebody man! Don't step aside. You want them to see that scowl. "I'm gonna scowl you, man! You better watch it!" Yeah, ... that's it. He's gonna move aside. Watch me scowl this old lady. "I'm gonna scowl you, bitch!" Yeah,.. that got her jumping...</p>

			<p>Scowling is an art. First, you gotta look the part. You should be overweight. If you're not, just wear padding under your clothes. The best scowlers are the ladies, ... fifty years old. If you're not fifty just try and look it. Just walk into any line up, at the bank or some ministry. Yeah, people getting their driver's licenses, or lining up to ask their directions at the courthouse or something. Just stand behind the counter and scowl at everybody. Now, if you're looking slightly overweight, and female, and over fifty you can get away with standing there, scowling at everybody. Heck, people don't know who she is! She just stands there. Maybe point at the poor nervous soul working over there at the counter saying, "He is going to look after you." You're damn right he is. He's nervous. Oh, she's gonna scowl at me. I better get this right. Oh! She's looking at me now. Don't look at me like that! I'm gonna scowl! I'm gonna scowl, watch it! Look here, wench, now I'm scowling! Now you done it! Here comes my supervisor. She's gonna scowl at you, too. You don't want to be here when that happens...</p>

			<p>Anybody can handle a scowl, but not everybody can master it. The master scowler will make you feel intimidated or leave you feeling bitter. The bitter scowler. Get that bitter feeling. Bitter is better. The better bitter gets the jobs. The better bitter gets to supervise everybody. Not only that, your job is to stand there and make everybody bitter. As many people as possible please... That's the essence of bitterness. It's better to get everybody feeling bitter, that way, you can feel bitter better. And, have better bitter. What this world needs is better bitter.</p>

			<p>Bitter. That's the <b>'in'</b> thing now...</p>
