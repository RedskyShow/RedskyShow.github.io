			<p><b>HIGMAND FREUD:</b> All life forms within my jurisdiction! I, am the Leader Of The Right Arm (Multilateral) Party (LOTRAP.) Welcome to the Gross Redsky Show In Text.</p>

			<p>One may ask, “What qualifies you for the position of Leader Of The Right Arm Party (LOTRAP)? In fact, where did you come from? Who exactly, are you?” Well, I’ll lay it on the line for you. I come from a similar background as some of the other members of the Gross Redsky Show In Text. I lived in my Native Home until age seven, old enough to remember my Reserve &amp; Band Number. Then it was a series of foster homes until I left grade ten, and everything, behind me at the age of sixteen. I headed West.</p>

			<p>I am one credit short of a high school diploma, thanks to community colleges. I’ve had a variety of jobs as well. I have quality experience as a Desktop Publisher, Cook, Cleaner, Dishwasher and Flyer Distributor. I possess a Certificate in Desktop Publishing and a valid driver’s license. I have solid Ottawa references on demand. I have years of experience being on welfare, and in jail. I have an extensive criminal record, and,… I’m a treated, Certified Schizophrenic.</p>

			<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you all to the formation of a Multi-Level World Party, the Right Arm Party (RAP)! This is a, "Save the Earth!" Party! A Party that will execute Native and Indigenous People’s Ideals! Ideals that live in harmony with our Mother Earth! Respect for all life forms! The Right Arm Party (RAP) will use its right arm for the welfare of species! Stop the poisoning of our waters! Our right arm for the oceans, the air we breathe, and toward all forms of resources! Our right arm for languages, cultures, and arts! The Right Arm Party (RAP) will use its right arm for the benefit of the poor, the helpless, the sick. The Right Arm Party (RAP) means the end of war on this planet! So far, I seem to be the only one who cares! I am the best man to lead the Right Arm Party (RAP)! I’ve got the Spirit and the Soul! If you want to be the Leader Of The Right Arm Party (LOTRAP), you have to display your heart and soul in an application to the membership. So far, the Right Arm Party (RAP), is a Party, of (1) one. So I submit this application for my leadership, to myself. I am the elect. So, by Right Arm Party Articles, I, am now king!</p>

			<p>I hope to inspire confidence in the Right Arm Party (RAP)! I am willing speak up with my proposals, and ultimately change the Earth! I can restore the good name of America, so that terrorists no longer attack the U.S! I can restore the Empires of France, Spain, China, and Italy! I propose that others apply for Empirical Status! I propose to reorganize the National Lines of the Globe! Within this new framework we can decide on many issues. A world currency, or not? World Citizenship for those who require such a thing! Citizens of any jurisdiction should have their rights and benefits adhered to regardless of residence. Personally, I would rather pay taxes to a Native Jurisdiction, regardless of my residence, and have my rights and benefits adhered to. I hope that I have convinced you to get a membership and support the Right Arm Party (RAP). I’ll be taking all of your talents, and putting them to good use.</p>
