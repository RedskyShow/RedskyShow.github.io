			<p><b>FUJ GROSS:</b> Welcome to the Gross Redsky Show In Text. I'm one of your co-hosts, Fuj Gross. So, Israel made a declaration of war on Palestine by moving in the heavy artillery and shooting people. Well, that's what Palestine says, anyway...I remember being too young to enlist in the American Army so that I could go to Vietnam to shoot people. Infantry was a state of heaven to me. Living for war. Being a soldier. Carry a rifle. Maybe have the title, "Lance," added to your rank, and shoot people. What a dream! I wanted to be James Bond and shoot people. Why, I'd shoot people for sport! Let me explain...</p>
			
			<p>I have no respect for people. I've had people rip me off for chunk change, numerous hundreds of dollars! Now I distrust people. It's people who destroy the Earth! Our climate is changing due to people. Species are being extinguished due to people. Let's face it, people are just not any good! I say, "Let's hunt them for sport. If you like, eat them!" Why let good meat go to waste? Too bad I'm a vegetarian. I don't want anybody to tell me that there's pork in my Polish sausage. Or how about chicken fed chickens in my chicken wings? I don't have a stomach for things gross. Meat is murder. But why does some of it taste so good? I really miss my Donair. I miss my Shawarma. This is all current Ottawa food. The Lebanese moved in. Some good vegetarian delicacies around here, too. Like Taboulie, Hommus, Falafel, and dessert treats like Baklava. Samosas come in vegetarian, so do Jamaican Patties, and all of it is affordable, from one to three dollars, Canadian.</p>
			
			<p>I'm getting hungry now. There's a great Indian restaurant that opened behind my place. The New Nupur Indian Restaurant on Bank Street in the Glebe, near the Queensway. They provide a vegetarian menu. Most good Asian or other restaurants do. I had a takeout meal there yesterday. I poured the liquid into the rice dish and it was fabulous! Indian food rocks! I found a good Chinese restaurant that will make me a combination plate on demand for $10.30 altogether. The Golden River Restaurant on Somerset Street in Ottawa, Canada just inside of Bronson Avenue. Daily specials are on the board across two walls. So much for food, I like to drink beer and smoke pot! That's my favourite pastime. How about you? Maybe you'd prefer to see me in jail with a criminal record. Well too bad! I beat you to it! I already have a criminal record and a sordid past. In fact, I'm a typical Native who resides in jails across Western Canada. I have a family history of poverty- stricken alcohol abuse across the spectrum! My only saving grace is that Gross Redsky made me the co-host of the Gross Redsky Show In Text. Gross Redsky sees something in me. All that I have to offer is contemptible! Why, I'm not even White! I know panhandlers, musicians, artists, and a few scum-bags! Most of whom are poverty stricken just like myself. I can't juggle. Can't dance. Maybe I'll just walk along, mumble to myself, maybe let you listen in... I'm talking five star entertainment for your viewing pleasure!</p>
