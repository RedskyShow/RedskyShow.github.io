			<p><b>FUJ GROSS:</b> Welcome to the Gross Redsky Show In Text. I'm your main co-host, Fuj Gross. Today on our show I have to deliver apologies for my last installment of text. Apparently, I have offended more than just a few people! I wrote something like; "I want to, and enjoy, shooting people!”?</p>

			<p>Well!? What?! You mean I can enjoy movies where you can shoot people, but I can't ‘dream' about shooting people? Permit me to remove the foot from my mouth. (That's where it usually is... with YOU people, anyway.) I don't physically go out there and SHOOT people! I mean, it's just a childhood fantasy! I mentioned the Vietnam War at the time? I was a child then. Shooting people was my childhood fantasy! After watching James Bond, Matt Helm, (played by Dean Martin,) and Bruce Lee, I wanted, as a child, to go out there and shoot people. Who needed an excuse? An excuse like, shoot bad people only. Or, shoot only those whom are shooting at you in a time of war. Who cares? As a child I wanted to shoot anybody. Everybody lives when you shoot them with invisible bullets! I mention shooting people in the same paragraph as I mention food and recommend vegetarian food and restaurants. Well, shooting people with invisible bullets makes me hungry! Anybody ever own a water pistol? For God's sake, a toy gun? Give one to a child? Throwing a snowball is a worse crime than my invisible bullets!</p>

			<p><i>Speaking of yodeling...</i></p>

			<p>You may be interested to know that I am a Status North American Indian, Native Heritage. I know a few words of my Annicianobe Language. My Tribe was originally written down as "Ojibwa,” but that is incorrect. We call ourselves "Annicianobe,” (An-Nish-A-Nobby.) You will encounter many spellings of anything to do with Natives. Every one spells the same things differently from one another. Especially when checking up on our history. Spelling is only now becoming standardized. Well, maybe not.</p>

			<p>I know that my other co-hosts, the R.R.R.A., Higmand Freud, and our main host, Mr. Gross Redsky, all come from the same race and have a similar background. That being, poverty stricken strife, days without meals at any given year from birth to date. Jail as a typical Native Resident who's probably there for the free room and board. I got a lot to say about our justice system, having seen it from the inside out. It seems that everybody gets brownie points for their number of convictions. Doesn't matter if you have the right suspect, as long as you get that conviction. The defendant's own lawyer would strive for a conviction as well. I, and everyone at the Gross Redsky Show, stand as witness to these facts. The province gets grants to house criminals, so they go out and try to fill the institutions with made up criminals. That's my impression. Perhaps they are trying to account for every crime. They don't care if the suspects match the crime. Well, sort of match anyway. Do you think we could get a conviction? Brownie points for everyone down the line! ... Who do I give my testimony to? I know, ... Higmand Freud, the Leader Of The Right Arm Party (LOTRAP) and head of our next government! I'll confess to the Right Reverent Revered Abbot (RRRA), and take my communion from him as well. Until next time, ... Ciao for now!</p>
