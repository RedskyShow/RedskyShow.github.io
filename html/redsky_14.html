			<p><b>RRRA:</b> Hello my fellow parishioners. This is the Gross Redsky Show In Text. I come in the service our Lord, the Risen Christ. I am your current co-host, the Right Reverent Revered Abbott (RRRA), at your service.</p>

			<p>Well! In my last segment, I had neglected to mention how I nearly lost my lunch in the presence of our main co-host, a Mr. Fuj Gross, and, in the presence of lovely naked ladies. The fact that I was amongst the presence of naked ladies, was the reason that I nearly lost my lunch and my appetite. It seems that I do not have the intestinal fortitude of a Mr. Fuj Gross! As I have stated, my church finds no disrepute with the entire surface industry of dancing nudes. I, however, will not be eating lunch in the presence of nudes. Not by myself, and not with a Mr. Fuj Gross, our mainstay here at the Gross Redsky Show In Text.</p>

			<p>It is not for us to question why a Mr. Gross Redsky would choose a Mr. Fuj Gross, as his main co-host. Even though a man of the cloth, such as myself, finds little in the name of redeeming qualities in the man. I am here to deliver the Lord’s forgiveness. I am not here to judge, that is the Lord’s job.</p>

			<p>I was hoping to read the Holy Bible one more time before I began quoting scripture to you. It seems that at times that people may quote scripture off the cuff then apply or cite some meaning to it. Even entire religions could adhere to principles that were supposedly interpreted from the Bible. I am here to say that any could be mistaken. Many times scripture is taken out of context. Other quotes and principles may not even be taken from the Bible, but were merely, “imagined,” somewhere down the line. How many people have actually read the Holy Bible? If so, which translation? Some are misleading, such as the Old English of the King James Version, or inaccurate, such as some children’s versions. The version of the Holy Bible that is promoted and adhered to by my church is the New International Version (NIV). One of the features of the NIV is that the paragraphs are separated from the poetry. Also, there are notations referring to other translations and to other books of the Bible. Right Reverent Revered Abbott (RRRA) recommends the NIV.</p>

			<p>One example of my rhetoric to you all is my interpretation of the Holy Communion. Churches have honoured this ritual of our Lord with great ceremony. There are longer versions and shorter versions. My version to you is the shortest one there is. Let us all now partake in Holy Communion. All Christ said on the subject was, “Think of Me as you eat this bread,” and, “Think of Me as you drink this wine.” That is your entire Holy Communion. Now, follow my text and do as I say if you wish me to administer to you your Holy Communion. Simply gather a form of bread, and a form of wine or drink. As you eat the bread, think of Christ. Now, as you drink your wine, think of Christ. Congratulations! I have just administered to you your Holy Communion with Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Now for my short prayer. You may pray your prayer if you like. But for now, here’s mine, for you:.. “Dear Lord, grant us your guidance and your Wisdom, and may God bless us all... Amen(!)”</p>
