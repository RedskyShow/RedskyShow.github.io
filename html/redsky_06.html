			<p><b>RIGHT REVERENT REVERED ABBOT (RRRA):</b> Welcome to the Gross Redsky Show In Text. I’m your co-host, the Right Reverent Revered Abbot (RRRA.) We had a little rain but the weather has been wonderful lately. After a bit of a heat wave we now have tolerable temperatures. That’s enough of pleasantries. On to bitter things...</p>

			<p>I have just read the previous segments of the Gross Redsky Show In Text. I am appalled! There appears to be something mentally wrong with every co-host here! One segment had people following a bitterness trend and urges sporting a scowl! Mr. Fuj Gross likes to shoot people and he has no respect for humanity! Higmand Freud seems to want to promote promiscuous sexual activity by legalizing prostitution, and, God knows what! Everybody around here seems to smoke pot, drink beer, talk about the good old days in jail, buy pornography and visit strip clubs...(!) What kind of respect is that for a model of human behaviour?! Who are these mentally deranged people? Why am I here? In some parts of this country we call a show like the Gross Redsky Show In Text, crap..! Why would I want to be a part of crap? A crappie show?!!!</p>

			<p>Why? Well I struggled with that question for awhile. God gave me the answer. It was God who assigned Mr. Gross Redsky to ask me to come on to this show. As Mr. Gross Redsky put it, we have a pulpit in this show and on this website, and we should take full advantage of it. There are people in need of saving and I offer a bit of the good medicine. Christ walked amongst the Gentiles; I walk amongst the other co-hosts of this tawdry show. I will not tiptoe through this Hades. I will walk straight and proud and carry the Lord with me! The Holy Spirit will direct me past these obstacles of obscenity; namely these off-center certified schizophrenics at the Gross Redsky Show In Text. God help us all who read these blasphemous pages of text! Thank God for the saving grace of the Word of the Lord that I hope to deliver with the help of the Holy Spirit. I will deliver...</p>

			<p>Despite the insanity, I do like some of the rhetoric that is spoken by Mr. Higmand Freud of the Right Arm Party, (RAP,) the Party of One (POO.) He mentions going green and living in harmony with the universe. My church and principles agree with this principle. Respect life; practice safe sex, better land and resource management. All of these are principles supported by myself and church. Perhaps one day, state and church can work in harmony to promote some of these principles. As Fuj Gross said, promote vegetarianism and watch the meat market take a dive. We no longer have to kill for our food. I am sure that there will always be meat eaters, yet, I would like to see a drop in the number of animals that we kill for sustenance. Let’s respect all of God’s creatures from now on.</p>

			<p>It has been a while since I have read the Holy Bible, but I should read it again. I did not expect to be called into service as your Right Reverent Revered Abbot, (RRRA). My church recommends the New International Version (NIV), of the Holy Scriptures. I will deliver my interpretations to you once I have read them in Scripture. For now I have a little rhetoric of my own to deliver to you... Stay tuned to this web site and it’ll come.</p>
